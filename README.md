2. Moonloader
3. SAMPFuncs

<p>Use <b>Pause</b> button in-game to show the dialog.</p>
<p>Pressing <b>Pause</b> again will switch between chats.</p>
<p>Holding <b>Pause</b> will hide the dialog.</p>
<p>Press T to interact with the dialog using your mouse.</p>
<p>You can drag and change position of the dialog and notification box.</p>

### [Known issues]
